# How to use the course material
## Prerequisites

You should have this software installed:

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- An IDE, preferably [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), but you can also use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [VSCodium](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

## R version

You need a relatively recent version of R. This command should at least show `R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18)`:

```{r}
R.Version()$version.string
```

## Get the course material

Navigate here and clone the repository:

<https://github.com/JBGruber/ess-v2-web-scraping-data-management>

In RStudio go to "Create a project" (top left corner with this symbol ![](media/new_project.png)).
Then select "Version Control":

![](media/wizard.png)

Or if you are using the command line, you can simply type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBGruber/ess-v2-web-scraping-data-management.git
# OR
git clone git@github.com:JBGruber/ess-v2-web-scraping-data-management.git
```

## How I will work

I tend to jump back and forth between the slides and RStudio

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Slides

![](media/slide-view.png)

See the html file in each session folder
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Source

![](media/qmd-view.png)

See the qmd file in each session folder
:::

::::

## Use the course marerial

1. Pull the latest version at the beginning of each session
2. Make a copy of the qmd file and name it, e.g., "1_Introduction_to_Computing_notes.qmd"
3. Use this file to make notes, for example by adding comments using this syntax `<!-- your comment -->` (RStudio shortcut Ctrl + Shift + C / Command + Shift + C on macOS)
- Alternatively, open the slides in a browser and press `e` to export them to PDF (and take notes with PDF reader)

<span style='color:red;'>This is to make sure you don't get any git conflicts when you pull and I updated something in the material in the meantime.</span>

<!-- This is a comment. You can leave them here to take notes linked to the slides. -->

## Your turn (Exercises 1)

1. Download the course material and open the RStudio project or folder in your IDE
2. Open the file `readme.qmd` from the file explorer of your IDE
3. Execute the final code Chunk to install all packages we will need for this course

# `R` (re-)fresher
## Packages

- `R` organises its functions in packages (even base functions)
- Most packages must be installed (once) and attached (every new session)

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Accessing Functions

If you do not want to attach an entire package, you can use the Double Colon to only use a specific function:

```{r}
dplyr::select(iris, Sepal.Length)
```

Less often used, you can also do this with `library`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library("dplyr", include.only = c("select", "mutate"))
mutate(iris, sepal_length = Sepal.Length * 10) |> 
  select(sepal_length)
```

## The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

- Central repository for `R` packages
- Rigorous policies and testing
- Currently more than 21k packages (July 2024)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: true
library(rvest)
# archive_links <- read_html("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/") |>
#   html_elements("a") |> 
#   html_text2() |> 
#   stringr::str_subset("/$")
# 
# get_first <- function(a) {
#   x <- paste0("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/", a) |> 
#     read_html() |> 
#     html_table() |> 
#     purrr::pluck(1) |> 
#     dplyr::select(Name, "Last modified")
#   x |> 
#     dplyr::mutate(mod = st("Last modified", ))
# }  

    
current <- read_html("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html") |> 
  html_table()

current |>
  purrr::pluck(1) |>
  dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(Date)) |>
  dplyr::count(date) |>
  dplyr::mutate(n = cumsum(n)) |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = date, y = n)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(linewidth = 2) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 year", date_labels = "%Y", 
                        limits = as.Date(c("1997-01-01", "2025-01-01"))) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Number of R packages on CRAN*", 
                caption = "*Archived packages were ignored") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
```


## Other sources?

- Rigorous policies and testing are also a downside
  - Developers hesitate to submit packages
  - Unmaintained (but functional) packages are removed from CRAN
- Alternative repositories are common:
  - GitHub and Gitlab (and SVN)
  - Bioconductor, R-universe :rocket:, R-Forge and Omegahat

```{r}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/paperboy")

# Install package from Bioconductor
BiocManager::install(c("GenomicRanges", "Organism.dplyr"))

# Install 'magick' from 'ropensci' universe
install.packages("magick", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Help!

One of the most important commands in `R`: `?`/`help`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
?install.packages # And
?remotes::install_github # OR
help("install_github", package = "remotes")
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
All help files in `R` follow the same structure and principle (although not all help files contain all elements):

- **Title**
- **Description**
- **Usage**:very important: shows you the default values for all arguments (i.e., what is used if you do not set anything) and assumed order

```{r}
#| eval: false
install_github("JBGruber/paperboy") # Same as
install_github(repo = "JBGruber/paperboy",  ref = "HEAD") # Same as
install_github(ref = "HEAD", repo = "JBGruber/paperboy") # Not(!) same as
install_github("HEAD", "JBGruber/paperboy")
```

- **Arguments**: description of arguments in a function. One special argument is the `...` (called ellipsis or dots) which is passed to underlying function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install_github("JBGruber/paperboy", Ncpus = 6)
```

- **Details**: Usually not that important but this is the first place to look when a function is not doing what you expect
- **Examples**: where I usually start to learn a new function by looking at cases that certainly work (and then rewriting them for my purposes).

```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23524101/220632749-da59fe90-d6a2-4ebd-bbfe-d1164e8a7944.mp4)

## Functions

Functions are easy to define in `R`:

```{r}
new_fun <- function(x = 1) {
  out <- c(
    sum(x),
    mean(x),
    median(x)
  )
  return(out)
}
new_fun()
vec <- c(1:10)
new_fun(x = vec)
```

Going through this bit by bit:

- **new_fun**: The name of the new function (convention: use something descriptive; don't use `.` or CamelCase but `_` if you have multiple words)
- **<-**: The assignment operator.
- **function(x)**: Define arguments and defaults here. 
- **{}**: Everything inside the curly brackets is the body of the function (code you are running when calling the function).
- **return()**: All objects created inside the function are immediately destroyed when the function finished running. Except what is put in `return()` (can be implicit).

## Data

In R, data is stored in objects.
We will learn about different ways to do so tomorrow!

## Loops
### For loops

Iterate over a vector:

```{r}
x <- NULL
for (i in 1:10) {
  message(i)
  x <- c(x, i)
}
x
```

- **for**: This is how you start the loop
- **i**: This is the variable which takes a different value in each iteration of the loop
- **in**: separates the variable from the vector
- **1:10**: The vector over which to iterate
- **{}**: The expression inside the round brackets is evaluated once for each value in the vector; `i` takes a different value each run

### Apply loops

Apply function to each element of a vector/list:

```{r}
foo <- function(i, silent = FALSE) {
  if (!silent) {
    message(i) 
  }
  return(i)
}
x <- lapply(1:10, foo)
unlist(x)
```

### purrr::map loops

Also apply function to each element of a vector/list, but coerce types:

```{r}
foo <- function(i, silent = FALSE) {
  if (!silent) {
    message(i) 
  }
  return(i)
}
x <- purrr::map_int(1:10, foo)
x
```

## if

`if` can be used to conditionally run code:

```{r}
if (TRUE) {
  1 + 1
}
```

```{r}
if (FALSE) {
  1 + 1
}
```

Any code that evaluates to a logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) can be used:

```{r}
if (1 + 1 == 2) {
  "Hello!"
}
```

You can extend this with `else`, which is executed when the original condition is `FALSE`:

```{r}
if (1 + 2 == 2) {
  "Hello!"
} else {
  "Bye"
}
```

## base `R`

Commonly people referring to *base* `R` mean all functions available when starting `R` but not loading any packages with `library(package)`.

```{r}
df <- mtcars # using a built-in example data.frame
table(df$cyl)
sum(df$cyl)
mean(df$cyl)
dist(head(df)) # calculates euclidian distance between cases
tolower(row.names(df))
```

Especially for simple operations and statistics, *base* is still great.

```{r}
model <- lm(hp ~ mpg, data = df) # simple linear regression
summary(model)
```

## base `R`

*base* also has a plotting system:

```{r}
plot(df$mpg, df$hp, col = "blue", ylab = "horse power", xlab = "miles per gallon", main = "Simple linear regression")
abline(model, col = "red")
text(30, 300, "We can add some text", col = "red")
```

## Tidyverse
### What is it?

- The official description: "The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures".
- The principle that gives the tidyverse its name is that of tidy data: "Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row." (see [tidyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) for more info)
- Seems trivial at first but as a principle can be quite consequential (e.g., it means that most object types are ignored and `data.frame`s are very dominant)
- Some coding principles attached to it (e.g., the pipe, functions as verbs that build on each other)

### The pipe

- Formerly `%>%`, now native in `R` as `|>`
- Forwards the result of one function to another
- Makes for much more readable code:

```{r}
transform(aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = subset(mtcars, hp > 100), FUN = function(x) round(mean(x, 2))), kpl = mpg * 0.4251)
```

You Can make this more readable by createing intermediate objects:

```{r}
data1 <- subset(mtcars, hp > 100) # take subset of original data
data2 <- aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = data1, FUN = function(x) round(mean(x, 2))) # aggregate by taking rounded mean
transform(data2, kpl = mpg * 0.4251) # convert miles per gallon to kilometer per liter
```

Or you use the pipe:

```{r}
subset(mtcars, hp > 100) |> 
  aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = _, FUN = function(x) round(mean(x, 2))) |> 
  transform(kpl = mpg * 0.4251)
```

`tidyverse` functions are written with pipes in mind and are named as verbs with the goal to tell you exactly what they do:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars |> 
  filter(hp > 100) |> 
  group_by(cyl) |> 
  summarise(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = function(x) x |> mean() |> round(2))) |> 
  mutate(kpl = mpg * 0.4251)
```

Note: You can interject the `View()` command at any line in a complicated pipeline to see the intermediate result in a spreadsheet-style data viewer.

### Special package `ggplot2`

- Completely overhauls the plotting system in `R`
- IMO: the best plotting system in any programming/data science language
- Implements the "Grammar of Graphics": a language for describing custom plots instead of relying on predefined plotting functions
- The specific logic makes it harder to learn than other packages, but you can express essentially any plots in it (I highly recommend using ["ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis"](https://ggplot2-book.org/) to learn the package instead of individual tutorials)

## Exercises 2

1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see and why?
2. In the function `pb_collect()` from `paperboy`, what do the arguments `ignore_fails` and `connections` do?
3. Write a function that takes a numeric vector of miles per gallon consumption data and transforms it to kilometer per liter. If anything other than a numeric vector is entered, the function should display an error (hint: see ?stop).
4. In the code below, check the sizes of the intermediate objects with `object.size()`.

```{r}
file_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawn-y-sun/Customer_Analytics_Retail/main/purchase%20data.csv"
df <- read.csv(file_link)
filtered_df <- df[df$Age >= 50,]
aggregated_df <- aggregate(filtered_df$Quantity, by = list(filtered_df$Day), FUN = sum)
names(aggregated_df) <- c("day", "total_quantity")
aggregated_df[order(aggregated_df$total_quantity, decreasing = TRUE)[1:5],]
```

5. How could the code above be improved if you only want the final result, the code should be readable and you care about memory usage?

# Literate Programming
## Background

> “The language in which we express our ideas has a strong influence on our thought processes.”
>
> ― Donald Ervin Knuth, Literate Programming

- When analysing data in R, a cornerstone of a good workflow is documenting what you are doing.
- The whole point of doing data analysis in a programming language rather than a point and click tool is reproducibility.
- Yet if your code does not run after a while and you don't understand what you were doing when writing the code, it's as if you had done your whole analysis in Excel!

## Advantages 

This is where *literate programming* has a lot of advantages:

1. **Enhanced Documentation**: Literate programming combines code and documentation in a single, integrated document. This approach encourages researchers to write clear and comprehensive explanations of their code, making it easier for others (and even themselves) to understand the working of the code, (research) design choices, and logic.
2. **Improved Readability**: By structuring code and documentation in a literate programming style, the resulting code becomes more readable and coherent. The narrative flow helps readers follow the thought process and intentions of the programmer, leading to improved comprehension and maintainability.
3. **Modular and Reusable Code**: Literate programming emphasizes the organization of code into coherent and reusable chunks as they writers come to think of them similar to paragraphs in a text, where each chunk develops one specific idea.
4. **Collaboration and Communication**: Literate programming enhances collaboration among developers by providing a common platform to discuss, share, and review code. The narrative style fosters effective communication, allowing team members to understand the codebase more easily and collaborate more efficiently.
5. **Extensibility and Maintenance**: Well-documented literate programs are typically easier to extend and maintain over time. The clear explanation of choices and functionality helps yourself and others in the future to make decisions about modifications, enhancements, and bug fixes.
6. **Reproducibilty and accountability**: when you save rendered output of an analysis, you know exactly how a table of plot was created. If there are several versions, you can always turn to the rendered document and check which data, code and package versions were used to do your analuysis (at least when documents were written in a specific way.

Quarto (and its predecessor R Markdown) were designed to make it easy for you to make the most of these advantages.
We have already been using these tools throughout the workshop and I hope this made you more familiar with them.

## Exercises 4

1. Use the function `report_template()` from my package [jbgtemplates](https://github.com/JBGruber/jbgtemplates) to start a new report
2. Add some simple analysis in it and render
3. Play around with the [formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html) and produce at least a PDF and Word output of your document
4. Think about how the structure of the document enhances reproducibility

# Some other tricks
## The worst default setting in RStudio

![](media/rstudio_data.png)

The default setting to ask whether to save the current session is horrible.
It eventually leads to you clicking yes, save the data and to the creation of a file called `.Rdata`.
This file is loaded whenever you open RStudio!
This makes RStudio slow and can lead to unexpected behaviour, even when you delete all objects in your environment with `rm(list = ls())`.

![](media/house.jpeg)

## Exercises

1. Change that setting NOW and look for the `.Rdata` in your project and home directory.


## Git some Version Control

Git is an extensive application and too much to go through.
But you do not need all the functionality to make efficient use of it's main promise: keeping track of what is happening in your projects and giving you the ability to revert to an older state of your project.

![](media/github.com_JBGruber_PhD_commits_master.png)

This screenshot shows the last months of my PhD, when I was furiously working on integrating comments from different people.
Not only helped git to show me my progress nicely, I also did not have to worry about accidentally deleting anything that might still prove valuable.
Especially towards the end, I often removed sections or copied them to other chapters.
Whenever I could not find a specific section, I went back to the last commit when I could still remember where it was.

Additionally, GitHub offers some nice features to organise and plan projects around *issues*.

![](media/github.com_project.png)

Here you can note down remaining problems and keep track of your progress.
It keeps your head free for other things!

# Homework

Many of you did not come to class to just scrape exercise pages.
You probably had some initial data and/or research question in mind.
Please write a short abstract on what you want to accomplish with the web scraping and data management skills you will learn here.
The abstract should include:

- general goal
- research question
- (preliminary) assessment what data you need what data can be found on the website and what potential research questions you have in mind.

Deadline: Tuesday midnight
