## The Plan for Today

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
In this session, you learn:

- why and how to work with relational data
- how to join data from different tables in `R`
- how to join data from different tables in `SQL`

# Relational data
## Why do we need to join data?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single data frame
- As we learned in session 2: good tables don't contain redundancies (information about different entities should be stored separately)
- Most databases use a relational database management system (or RDBMS)
- Practically, we always think of relations as a connection of two tables
- Relations of three or more tables are always a property of the relations between each pair

## Basic concept: keys

- **primary key**: a variable or set of variables (which is then called a **compound key**) that uniquely identifies each observation
- **foreign key**: a variable (or set of variables) that corresponds to a primary key in another table

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" }
```{r}
df1 <- tibble(
  id = 1:6,
  capital_letters = LETTERS[1:6]
)
df1
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%" }
```{r}
df2 <- tibble(
  id = c(1:5, 7),
  lowercase_letters = letters[c(1:5, 7)]
)
df2
```

## Two different joins

- **Mutating joins**: add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.
- **Filtering joins**: filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in another.

## Many to many

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- When you get a many-to-many instead of a many-to-one join, it can indicate a problem
- Either you have chosen the wrong key by accident or your data model is wrong
- But the question is a conceptual one:
  + For example, several pets usually have the same species and breed, but one pet should have one breed (or maybe a mix)
  + But a single pet can have multiple owner, and each owner can have multiple pets

## Exercises 1

1. See if some of the other variables influence support for Sanders or Clinton
2. Below I prepared code that loads data from the `nycflights13` package which is about flights departing NYC in 2013:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
data(airports)
data(flights)
data(weather)
data(planes)
data(airlines)
```

The dataset is perfect for practicing joining data, as the set is split into tables that relate to each other.
You can see the relation in the diagram below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/diagrams/relational.png)

Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What data frames would you need to combine?

3. Add the location of the origin *and* destination (i.e. the `lat` and `lon`) to `flights`.
4. Which airlines departed most often from the NYC airports (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWR). Use their real names not the abbreviation
5. How could you calculate the average age of the planes departing from NYC? (hint: you can calculate averages with `mean()`, you might want to use `na.rm = TRUE`)


# Intro to *Structured query language* (`SQL`)
## Why learn `SQL`?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- managing tables in files instead of a database is error-prone:
  + you need to keep files consistent
  + you need to maintain relational integrity
- using files instead of a database is slow:
  + you have to read in files before doing operations on the data (although systems like `arrow` improve the situation)
  + you need to use your local hardware instead of a remote server (although you could SSH into a server)
  + collaboration is limited and again error-prone
- database management system (DBMS), which solve these issues often speak `Structured Query Language` (`SQL`)

:::
::::


## `SQL` basic syntax

- `R` has a generic interface to communicate with relational databases: *R Database Interface* or `DBI`

```{r}
library(DBI)
```

To communicate with a specific database format, `DBI` needs a driver

```{r}
library(RSQLite)
```

- **RSQLite**: translates `R` commands to *SQLite*
- **SQLite**: a free and open source, well-known embedded database engine 

## Creating and connecting to an SQLite database

```{r}
dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)
unlink("data/db.sql") # just to make sure we use a new db
db <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "data/db.sql")
db
class(db)
```

- **dbConnect()**: sets up a connection
- **SQLite()**: provides the driver for the specific DBMS

Let's see what's in the database so far:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master")
```

Nothing. SQLite databases are typically stored in a single file:

```{r}
file.size("data/db.sql")
```

Our file has the size 0, which means it consists just of a place-holder.

## Adding a table to the SQLite database

So far, the database is empty:

```{r}
# this is a shorthand for "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master" above
dbListTables(db) 
```

Before we can add data, we have to create a table in the database:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "CREATE TABLE df1 (
            election_id integer,
            capital_letters varchar)")
dbListTables(db)
```

Besides integer and varchar (suitable for short strings), you can also use `real` (numeric), dates and blob (stored as binary data).

Now we can add cases:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (1, 'A')")
```

And we can pull the data back out:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```

We can start from scratch by deleting this table:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "DROP TABLE df1")
```

## Adding a table with constraints

We dropped the last table, so the database is empty again

```{r}
dbListTables(db)
```

Let's define the table again, but add constraints to enforce certain data:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "CREATE TABLE df1 (
              id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              capital_letters VARCHAR(1) CHECK (capital_letters GLOB '[A-Z]'), 
              my_date DATE CHECK (my_date > '2000-01-01')
          )")
dbListTables(db)
```

- `id` is now a primary key, which makes sure that it is unique
- the field `capital_letters` is now constrained to capital letters
- only dates in 2000 or later are allowed

## Adding a table with constraints {visibility="uncounted"}

Let's try to add a case:

```{r}
#| error: true
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (1, 'a', '1999-12-31')")
```

Let's try again with a capital letter:

```{r}
#| error: true
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (1, 'A', '1999-12-31')")
```

OK, let's adhere to the constraints:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (1, 'A', '2000-12-31')")
```

And let's test the last constraint:

```{r}
#| error: true
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (1, 'A', '2000-12-31')")
```

## Adding Data

We already know how to add a complete case:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1
            VALUES (2, 'B', '2000-12-31')")
```

But you can also add a case with a missing value:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1 (id, capital_letters)
            VALUES (3, 'C')")
```

OR:

```{r}
dbExecute(db,
          "INSERT INTO df1 
            VALUES (4, 'D', NULL)")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```

## Updating Data

If we made a mistake or something changes, we can update a specific row:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "UPDATE df1
               SET my_date = '2023-07-22'
               WHERE id = 3")
```

Or we can add a new variable and calculate it from existing values:

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "ALTER TABLE df1 ADD year integer")
dbExecute(db, "UPDATE df1
               SET year = strftime('%Y', my_date)")
```

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```

## Accessing Data

We have already seen the `SELECT` command, let's explore what else we can do!

Access only certain fields:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT id, year FROM df1")
```

Access only certain rows:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT id, year 
                FROM df1
                WHERE year > 2000")
```

Computing new values on the fly:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT id, my_date, strftime('%d, %m', my_date) FROM df1")
```


##  Deleting Data

Two ways to get rid of data:

- `DELETE`: used to remove rows from a table
- `DROP`: used to remove entire database objects like tables, databases, indexes, or views

```{r}
dbExecute(db, "DELETE FROM df1 
               WHERE id = 1")
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```


```{r}
#| error: true
dbExecute(db, "DROP TABLE df1")
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM df1")
```


## `SQL` basic syntax: summary

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- insensitive to line breaks
- case-insensitive
- convention to spell SQL keywords in upper case, and names of tables, columns, and functions in lower case
- important verbs are:
  + `CREATE`: define a new table
  + `INSERT`: add new rows to a table
  + `UPDATE`: modify existing rows in a table
  + `ALTER`: modify existing fields in a table
  + `SELECT`: query data from one or more tables
  + `DELETE`: remove rows from a table
  + `DROP`: remove a database object (e.g., table)

:::
::: {.column width="50%" }
```{r sql-filter}
#| eval: false
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * 
                FROM df1
                WHERE id < 4")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
dbGetQuery(db, "sELeCt id FROM Df1")
```

## `SQL` basic syntax (from `R`)

There are a couple of useful functions in the `DBI` package/the driver packages.
We've seen the `dbListTables` already:

```{r}
dbListTables(db)
```

You can also create a table from a data.frame:

```{r}
dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "df1", value = df1)
dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "df2", value = df2)
```

And get information about the defined fields (fields is the equivalent of columns):

```{r}
dbListFields(conn = db, name = "df1")
dbListFields(conn = db, name = "df2")
```

## `SQL` basic syntax (from `R`) {visibility="uncounted"}

We can read the entire table back into `R`:

```{r}
dbReadTable(conn = db, "df1")
```

Delete (drop) a table:

```{r}
dbRemoveTable(conn = db, "df1")
```

Check if a table exists

```{r}
if (!dbExistsTable(conn = db, "df1")) {
  message("df1 does not exist. Creating it")
  dbWriteTable(conn = db, name = "df1", value = df1)
}
```

## Exercises 2

1. create a new table in `db` called `elections` with the fields: `election_id`, `country_name`, `election_date`, `party_id`, `vote_share`, `seats`, and  `seats_total`. Choose appropriate data types for the fields (maybe peak ahead to the next exercise).
2. Using SQL syntax, add this data to the `elections` table:

| election_id | country_name | election_date | party_id | vote_share | seats | seats_total |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| 1030        | Austria      | 1919-02-16    | 97       | 40.75      | 72    | 170         |

3. Using SQL syntax, add this data to the `elections` table:

| election_id | country_name | election_date | vote_share | party_id |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 872         | Belgium      | 1908-05-24    | 22.6       | 2422     |

4. Querying data from `elections`, create an `R` object that has the `election_id`, `party_id` and `vote_share` fields for elections after 1910.
5. Querying data from `elections`, get `election_id`, `party_id`,  `vote_share` fields and just the year of the election.
6. Add a new field `vote_share_prop` to the `elections` database which shows the vote share as proportion rather than a percentage.

## Exercises 3

1. Add the three `data.frames` from the 2016 primaries case study to the database (`schedule`, `results_state`, and `facts`)
2. Right join `results_state` and `facts`
3. Recreate the table `results_state_time` by querying and joining from db. Hint: multiple keys can be used by putting AND between them, e.g., `ON df1.id = df2.id AND df1.id2 = df2.id2`.

# `dbplyr`
## Working with connections in `R`

If you think `SQL` is not necessarily your thing, there is good news: `dbplyr` makes it possible to connect to tables and use `dplyr` syntax.
You don't have to attach `dbplyr` for that, you just need `dplyr` and have `dbplyr` installed.

```{r}
library(dbplyr) # you don't usually need to load this, just have it installed
```

Let's create a new table for that:

```{r}
dbWriteTable(db, "diamonds", diamonds)
```

To connect to a table in a database, we can use `tbl`:

```{r}
diamonds_con <- tbl(db, "diamonds")
diamonds_con
```

## Working with connections in `R`  {visibility="uncounted"}

However, this table is just a connections, and `R` has pulled only the first couple of rows to display them.

```{r}
object.size(diamonds)
object.size(diamonds_con)
```

This is also why `View` doesn't really work well:

```{r}
#| eval: false
View(diamonds_con)
```

## `collect`

To get the object in `R` properly, you need to `collect` the data first:

```{r}
x_df <- collect(diamonds_con)
```

`x_df` is now a real data.frame

```{r}
object.size(x_df)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
View(diamonds_con)
```

## Supports `dplyr` verbs

Filter, select, mutate and summarise:

```{r}
diamonds_con |> 
  filter(cut == "Premium", 
         price < 400) |> 
  select(price) |> 
  mutate(price_gbp = price * 0.77) |> 
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price),
            avg_price_gbp = mean(price_gbp))
```

Joins also work:

```{r}
df1_con <- tbl(db, "df1")
df2_con <- tbl(db, "df2")
df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  collect()
```

## Supports `dplyr` verbs  {visibility="uncounted"}

If you decide to implement this query somewhere else, you can show it after executing it:

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  show_query()
```

## `collect()` vs. `compute()`

- `collect()` gets data from the database; like `dbGetQuery()`
- `compute()` changes data in the database; like `dbExecute()`

We join the two tables again, and also compute a new column:

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  mutate(all_letters = paste(capital_letters, 
                             lowercase_letters)) |> 
  collect()
```

Instead of just bringing this new table to `R`, we can directly save it to the database

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  mutate(all_letters = paste(capital_letters, 
                             lowercase_letters)) |> 
  compute() # only this line is different!
```

## `collect()` vs. `compute()` {visibility="uncounted"}

However, if we look at the table, it still looks the same

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  collect()
```

So what gives?

## `collect()` vs. `compute()` {visibility="uncounted"}

When we list the tables, we see what happened:

```{r}
dbListTables(db)
```

`dbplyr` by default does not overwrite the original table, but instead saves the results to a new, temporary table (they are removed when you disconnect from the db).

If we want to create a persistent version of the table, we can do:

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  mutate(all_letters = paste(capital_letters, 
                             lowercase_letters)) |> 
  compute(temporary = FALSE, name = "df1_updated")
```

```{r}
tbl(db, "df1_updated")
```

## `collect()` vs. `compute()` {visibility="uncounted"}

And finally, if we want to update the table in place, we can bring it into `R` and then copy it back to overwrite the old one:

```{r}
temp <- df1_con |> 
  left_join(df2_con, by = "id") |> 
  mutate(all_letters = paste(capital_letters, 
                             lowercase_letters)) |> 
  collect()
copy_to(db, temp, "df1", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Now, we replaced the original version:

```{r}
df1_con |> 
  collect()
```

## Case study: New York City flight data

Let's move the `nycflights13` into a new database:

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
unlink("data/db_nyc.sql") # just to make sure we use a new db
db_nyc <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "data/db_nyc.sql")
dbWriteTable(db_nyc, "airports", airports)
dbWriteTable(db_nyc, "flights", flights)
dbWriteTable(db_nyc, "weather", weather)
dbWriteTable(db_nyc, "planes", planes)
dbWriteTable(db_nyc, "airlines", airlines)
```

RQ1: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?
RQ2: What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/diagrams/relational.png)

## NYC flights: age vs delays

```{r}
plane_delays_age <- tbl(db_nyc, "flights") |> 
  inner_join(tbl(db_nyc, "planes"), by = "tailnum", suffix = c("", "_plane")) |> 
  mutate(plane_age = year - year_plane) |> 
  select(arr_delay, plane_age) |> 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay),
         !is.na(plane_age)) |> 
  collect()
```

```{r}
#| output-location: column
plane_delays_age |> 
  group_by(plane_age) |> 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = plane_age, y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


## NYC flights: weather conditions vs delays

```{r}
plane_delays_weather <- tbl(db_nyc, "flights") |> 
  inner_join(tbl(db_nyc, "weather"), by = c("time_hour", "origin")) |> 
  filter(!is.na(temp), !is.na(arr_delay), !is.na(wind_speed)) |> 
  collect()
```

```{r}
#| output-location: column
plane_delays_weather |>
  ggplot(aes(x = temp, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

```{r}
#| output-location: column
plane_delays_weather |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wind_speed, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


## Should you learn SQL properly?

It depends!

- how often and how advanced do you want to use it?
- do you want to stay in the `R` ecosystem or extend your knowledge beyond it?
- how many clients will use your database?

There is an interesting video discussing the question in more detail here: <https://youtu.be/gdzONbwfWk0>

# Homework

Tomorrow, we will use the software Docker to simulate a database server. Install the software and make sure it works. You can follow the guide I made here:

<https://youtu.be/iMyCdd5nP5U>

# When done, `dbDisconnect`

Whenever you are done working with a database, you should disconnect from it: 

```{r}
dbDisconnect(db)
```

- This closes the connection, discards all pending work, and frees resources
