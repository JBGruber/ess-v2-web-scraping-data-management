# Introduction
## The Plan for Today

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
In this session, we learn how to **scout** data in the wild.
We will:

- discuss web scraping from a theoretical point of view:
  - What is web scraping?
  - Why should you learn it?
  - What legal and ethical implications should you keep in mind?
- learn a bit more about how the Internet works
  - What is HTML
  - What is CSS

## Web Scraping

::: {.incremental}
- A technique to extract specific data from a web page
  - Get the author, title, date and body of an only news article
  - A table from a website (like Wikipedia)
- This can include hyperlinks which you can systematically go through
- You can write a "robot" that systematically extracts data and saves it in a format convenient for analysis
  - All news about a specific topic from a news site
  - All press releases from a political party website
  - All Posts on a web forum about a specific topic
  - All participants of an event from the event's website
- A web-scraper is a program that goes to web pages, downloads the contents, extracts data out of the contents and then saves the data to a file or a database
- Unfortunately not one-size-fits-all solution
  - Lots of different techniques, tools, tricks
  - Websites change (some more frequently than others)
  - Some websites make it hard for you (by accident or on purpose!)
:::

## Web Scraping: A Three-Step Process

1. Send an HTTP request to the webpage -> server responds to the request by returning HTML content
2. Parse the HTML content -> extract the information you want from the nested structure of HTML code
3. Wrangle the data into a useful format

## Hurdles

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%" .incremental}
Some web pages are easier to scrape than others:

1. Well behaved static HTML with recurring patterns
2. Haphazard HTML not clearly differentiating between different types of information
3. Interactive web sites loading content by executing code (usually JavaScript or PHP)
4. Interactive web sites with mechanisms against data extraction (rate limits, captchas etc.)

# Why Should You Learn Web Scraping?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The internet is a data gold mine!
- Data was not created for research, but are often traces of what people are *actually* doing on the internet
- Reproducible and renewable data collection (e.g., rehydrate data that is copyrighted)
- Web Scraping let's you automate data retrieval (as opposed to using tedious copy & past on some web site)
- It's one of the most fun tasks to learn R and programming!
  - It's engaging and satisfying to find repeating patterns that you can employ to structure data (every website becomes a little puzzle)
  - It touches on many important computational skills
  - The return is good data to further your career (unlike sudokus or video games)

## Exercises

1. Discuss in class: What data would you like to be able to retrieve after the course and why?

# Implications of Web Scraping
## Legal

Web Scraping is not a shady or illegal activity, **but** not all web scraping is unproblematic and the **data** does not become **yours**.

::: {.incremental}
- Collecting **personal data** of people in the EU might violate GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
  - The GDPR defines personal data as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person." (Art. 4 [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/))
  - Exceptions
    - if you get consent from the people whose data it is
    - personal data processing is legitimate when "necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest" (Art. 6 [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/))
- Collecting **copyrighted** data
  - Complicated legal situation
  - Public facing content is probably okay ([9th circuit ruling](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kek83/linkedin-data-scraping-lawsuit-shot-down))
  - You will probably get in trouble if you distribute the material
  - "there have been no lawsuits in [...] major western democratic countries stemming from a researcher scraping publicly accessible data from a website for personal or academic use." [@luscombewebscraping2022]
- Honouring Terms of Service and robots.txt
  - Many companies have ToS that might prohibit you from scraping (these are not laws, might not be binding and whether they can be enforced is a separate question)
  - /robots.txt is often where guidelines are communicated to automated crawlers
:::

## ToS and Robots.txt

![](media/twitter.com_en_tos.png)

[Twitter ToS](https://twitter.com/en/tos#intlTerms)

```html
User-agent: *                         # the rules apply to all user agents
Disallow: /EPiServer/CMS/             # do not crawl any URLs that start with /EPiServer/CMS/
Disallow: /Util/                      # do not crawl any URLs that start with /Util/ 
Disallow: /about/art-in-parliament/   # do not crawl any URLs that start with /about/art-in-parliament/
```
<https://www.parliament.uk/robots.txt>


## Ethical

- Are there other means available to get to the data (e.g., via an API)?
- `robots.txt` might not be legally binding, but it is not nice to ignore it
- Scraping can put a heavy load on website (if you make 1000s of requests) which costs the hosts money and might bring down a site ([DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack))
- Think twice before scraping personal data. You should ask yourself:
  - is it necessary for your research?
  - are you harming anyone by obtaining (or distributing) the data?
  - do you really need everything or are parts of the data sufficient (e.g., can you preselect cases or ignore variables)

## Exercises

Twitter recently made access to their API punishingly expensive and stopped free academic access for research.
If you wanted to do research on Twitter data through web-scraping anyway what implications would that have:

1. Legally

2. Ethically

3. Practical


# What are HTML and CSS
## What is HTML
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser
- Contains the raw data (text, URLs to pictures and videos) plus defines the layout and some of the styling of text

## What is CSS

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is very often used in addition to HTML to control the presentation of a document
- Designed to enable the separation of *content* from things concerning the *look*, such as layout, colours, and fonts.
- The reason it is interesting for web scraping is that **certain information often get the same styling**

## Example: CSS

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple HTML Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="example.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="headline">My Headline</h1>
  <p class="author">Me</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This is the body of the text.</p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/About_The_Dog.jpg/640px-About_The_Dog.jpg" alt="About The Dog.">
    <p>Consider this data:</p>
    <table>
      <tr class="top-row">
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>John</td>
          <td>25</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Mary</td>
          <td>26</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
</body>
</body>
</html>

```

CSS:

```css
/* CSS file */

.headline {
  color: red;
}

.author {
  color: grey;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.top-row {
  background-color: lightgrey;
}

.content img {
  border: 2px solid black;
}

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

# HTMl and CSS in Web Scraping: a preview
## Using HTML tags:

You can select HTML elements by their tags

```{r}
library(rvest)
read_html("data/example.html") |> 
  html_elements("p") |> 
  html_text()
```

- written without the `<>`
- in theory, arbirary tags are possible, but commonly people use `<p>` (paragraph), `<br>` (line break), `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, ... (first, second, third, ... level headline), `<b>` (bold), `<i>` (italic), `<img>` (image), `<href>` (hyperlink), and a couple more.

## Using attributes

You can select elements by an attribute, including the class:

```{r}
read_html("data/example.html") |> 
  html_elements("[class=\"headline\"]") |> 
  html_text()
```

For `class`, there is also a shorthand:

```{r}
read_html("data/example.html") |> 
  html_elements(".headline") |> 
  html_text()
```

## Extracting attributes

Instead of selecting by arrtibute, you can also extract an attribute:

```{r}
read_html("data/example.html") |> 
  html_elements("a") |> 
  html_attr("href")
```

### Chaining selectors

If there is more than one element that fits your selector, but you only want one of them, see if you can make your selection more specific by chaining selectors with `>`:

```{r}
read_html("data/example.html") |> 
  html_elements(".author>a") |> 
  html_attr("href")
```

## Exercises

1. Add another image and another paragraph to `data/example.html` and display it in your browser
2. Add a second level headline to the page
3. Add another image to the page
4. Manipulate the files `data/example.html` and/or `data/example.css` so that "content" is displayed in italics
5. Practice finding the right selector with the CSS Diner game (<https://flukeout.github.io/>)

# Wrap Up

Save some information about the session for reproducibility.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
