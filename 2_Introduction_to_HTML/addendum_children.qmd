Question: What is the difference between chaining html selectors with `>` vs (white space).

Answer: `>` selects only direct children, (white space) selects descendants (elements that are children, grand children, great grand children and so on).

You can think of the family tree like a book. At the top level you have the book, then chapters, sections, subsections, subsubsections etc..

```{r}
readLines("data/children.html") |> 
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

```{r}
library(rvest)
html <- read_html("data/children.html")
html |>
  html_elements("chapter subsection")

html |>
  html_elements("chapter>subsection")
```

There is not subsection which is a direct decendant of a chapter, hence the selector does not retrieve anything.
