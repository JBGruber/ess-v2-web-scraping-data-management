## Abstract

This project examines irregular power transitions in the world since 1945.
Irregular power transitions are those that do not follow the established rules of succession, such as coups, overstays, and revolutions.
The goal of this project is to identify the determinants of irregular power transitions, with a focus on the role of regime type, government type, term limits, and the degree of democracy.

To accomplish this goal, I will collect data on a variety of factors, including:

-   Regime type (democracy, autocracy, monarchy, etc.)

-   Government type (presidentialism, parliamentarism, etc.)

-   Term limits and term length

-   Power transition type (regular or irregular)

-   Leader characteristics (age, gender, years in power, etc.)

-   Degree of democracy (Polity V index)

-   Economic indicators (GDP, GDP per capita, unemployment rate, etc.)

-   Corruption index
